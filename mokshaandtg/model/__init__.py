def init_model(engine):
    """Call me before using any of the tables or classes in the model."""
    # If you are using reflection to introspect your database and create
    # table objects for you, your tables must be defined and mapped inside
    # the init_model function, so that the engine is available if you
    # use the model outside tg2, you need to make sure this is called before
    # you use the model.

    #
    # See the following example:

    #global t_reflected

    #t_reflected = Table("Reflected", metadata,
    #    autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)

    #mapper(Reflected, t_reflected)


# Import your model modules here.
